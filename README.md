# Xiangqi
Xiangqi (Chineese chess) Project I made on my second term in universtiy for Introduction to Programming 2 lecture
You can learn more about the game at https://www.xiangqi.com

The game is played on terminal, the square that the piece is on and the square it will move are written in consecutively for example: d1e1
The main function is in the file "main.java"
The board is printed into the terminal and pieces are shown by the first letter of their names in Turkish:
Åž for King (it may not show as '?' in terminal)
V for Advisor
F for Elephant
A for Horse
K for Chariot
T for Cannon
Capital letterns represent black pieces and small letters represent white pieces.
As a CENG major second term homework it is flawed in a few ways such as the king can leave its palace on left side, and checkmate detection may be flawed (I am not aware of any other flaws and I would appreciate a comment if you find one.
